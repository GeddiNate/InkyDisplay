“I have seen God, lawkeeper,” Tan whispered. Where was he? “I have seen Death himself, with the nails in his eyes. I have seen the Survivor, who is life.”

Waxillium glanced at it and felt his heart clench. He hadn’t thought of Telsin in ages. They had been so distant most of their lives. Not by intent, like his distance from his uncle; Waxillium and the previous Lord Ladrian had often been at odds. No, his distance from Telsin had been one born more of laziness. Twenty years apart, seeing his sister only occasionally, had let him slide along without much contact.

But the mark of a great man is one who knows when to set aside the important things in order to accomplish the vital ones.”

He hesitated. What was he doing? He’d made his decision. Did he have to keep remaking it every few days?

Waxillium frowned. “I’d disagree. Most people seem basically good.” “Well, perhaps by one definition. But either attribute—good or evil—has to be pursued for it to be significant. People today … in general they are good, or sometimes evil, mostly by inertia, not by choice. They act as their surroundings prepare them to act.

“You are inexperienced. So was I once. So is everyone. The measure of a person is not how much they have lived. It is not how easily they jump at a noise or how quick they are to show emotion. It’s in how they make use of what life has shown them.”

voice answered him, distinct and unexpected. And a little is what you received, I think. Waxillium started. Well … could I have some more, then? Um, please? I must be careful in playing favorites, the voice inside his mind replied. It upsets the balance. You’re God. Isn’t playing favorites kind of the point? No, the voice replied. The point is Harmony—creating a way for as many as possible to make their own choices. Waxillium lay staring up at the swirling mists. The blast had dazed him worse than he’d thought. Are you divine, the voice asked of him, as Miles claims that Allomancers are? I … Waxillium thought. If I were, I doubt I’d be in this much pain. Then what are you? This is a very bizarre conversation, Waxillium thought back. Yes. How can you see things like what has been done by the Vanishers, Waxillium asked, and not do something to help? I have done something to help. I sent you.
