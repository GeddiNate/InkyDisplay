"Highlight (Orange)","Location 5787","","“But sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a person who is in the process of changing.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 5825","","He needed more than vague explanations and abstract ideas—but those were the very soul of art. If you could explain something perfectly, then you’d never need art."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5932","","“He came at me,” Adolin said, “in the training rooms, screaming that you’d found the killer. Said that if I didn’t come, you’d probably—and I quote—‘go do something stupid without letting me watch.’"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 6112","","Holding it immediately brought pain. Not the screaming of a dead spren. Pain inside. The pain of an Ideal sworn, but not yet overcome."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 13431","","This generation has had only one Bondsmith, and some blame the divisions among us upon this fact. The true problem is far deeper. I believe that Honor himself is changing. —From drawer 24-18, smokestone"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 13810","","“Power is a knife,” Wit said, taking his seat. “A terrible, dangerous knife that can’t be wielded without cutting yourself. We joked about stupidity, but in reality most people aren’t stupid. Many are simply frustrated at how little control they have over their lives. They lash out. Sometimes in spectacular ways…”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 13829","","“No. Hedonism has never been enjoyment, Shallan, but the opposite. They take the wonderful things of life and indulge until they lose savor. It’s listening to beautiful music, performed so loud as to eliminate all subtlety—taking something beautiful and making it carnal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 15465","","The enemy knew what she looked like. Should she have created a new persona, a false face, to not expose Veil? But Veil is a false face, a part of her said. You could always abandon her. She strangled that part of her, smothered it deep. Veil was too real, too vital, to abandon. Shallan would be easier."
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 15938","","Failure is the mark of a life well lived. In turn, the only way to live without failure is to be of no use to anyone. Trust me, I’ve practiced.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 15984","","“Take this fork,” Wit said. He waved his hand. Some of her Stormlight split off from her, spinning above his hand and making an image of a floating fork in the darkness. “It has a use. Eating. Now, if it were to be ornamented by a master artisan, would that change its function?” The fork grew intricate embossing in the form of growing leaves. “No, of course not. It has the same use, ornamented or not. The art is the part that serves no purpose.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 17759","","Szeth nodded. “I swear to seek justice, to let it guide me, until I find a more perfect Ideal.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 19528","","“But maybe you shouldn’t be looking for life to be easier because you choose to do something that is right!"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 22566","","Was"
"Note","Location 22566","","Humans came to roshar with Odiums Spren it was their power that destroyed the world. Only later did they bond the spren of honor which the singers didnt think they could do"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 22889","","The most important step a man can take. It’s not the first one, is it? It’s the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar."
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 22915","","“I will take responsibility for what I have done,” Dalinar whispered. “If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 22978","","“I’m broken.” “Who isn’t? Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 22984","","“I will protect those I hate. Even … even if the one I hate most … is … myself.”"
"Highlight (Pink)","Location 23010","","“No!” Odium screamed. He stepped forward. “No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU!”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 24956","","“All great art is hated,” Wit said. He shuffled in line—along with a couple hundred other people—one dreary step. “It is obscenely difficult—if not impossible—to make something that nobody hates,” Wit continued. “Conversely, it is incredibly easy—if not expected—to make something that nobody loves.”"
"Highlight (Orange)","Location 24962","","Art is about emotion, examination, and going places people have never gone before to discover and investigate new things. The only way to create something that nobody hates is to ensure that it can’t be loved either. Remove enough spice from soup, and you’ll just end up with water.”"
"Highlight (Pink)","Location 24989","","On the other hand, if Rayse learned that Wit was in the city, he’d order his forces to level it—and would consider that a cheap price for even the slimmest chance of ending him."
